## Hi there

I'm Luis Thomson and I'm a computer science student at University of Sonora. I enjoy using my programming skills to create fun and interesting projects, I'm interested in machine learning, image and video manipulation and everything related to videogames and videogame development. 

The thing that I enjoy most about programming is the ability to have fun in ways that otherwise wouldn't be possible, I like working in projects that maybe aren't all that useful of practical but are definitely fun and interesting. When I'm not programming I pass the time by reading and occasionaly playing videogames, I'm really drawn to old horror novels and old videogames.
