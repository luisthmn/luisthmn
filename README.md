## Hi there

I'm a computer science graduate at University of Sonora. I enjoy using my programming skills to create fun and interesting projects, I'm interested in machine learning, image and video manipulation and videogame development. 

The thing that I enjoy most about programming is the ability to have fun in ways that otherwise wouldn't be possible, I like working in projects that I find fun and interesting. When I'm not programming I pass the time by reading and occasionaly playing videogames.
